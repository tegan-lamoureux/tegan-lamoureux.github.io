Hey! I'm Tegan. Here's your standard introduction post.

I switched over to Jekyll and Github Pages last summer, but with school and life, I never got around to finalizing it, or adding any content. After a round of furious edits, I'm (mostly) happy with it. Jekyll makes it incredibly easy to generate content, and I love the simplicity of a static website.

I don't have any particular plans for this, and intended it as just another method of internet presence/light blogging & social media.

Let's see. Recent exciting things:

+ As part of a degree requirement, I ended up taking an introduction to fiction course last term that I enjoyed *way more* than I ever expected to. I think it's going to be a new hobby.
+ I'm hoping to start cello lessons soon! :violin:
+ I just ordered a new Raspberry Pi 3, with a super neat [Display-O-Tron Hat](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/display-o-tron-hat), which is going to function as a public facing (Open)VPN server for my home network, as well as other fun things! (read: [SDR experimentation](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/), ADS-B aircraft tracking, and a public facing XMPP server - for funsies.)
+ I went hiking in the Columbia gorge recently with a friend, and it was SUPER ULTRA BEAUTIFUL. I'll show off some photos below. They were shot on an old 35mm SLR with Kodak Ektar 100 film.

Anyways. Here's to keeping up with commitments, keeping up with friends, and a good 2017. :beer:
