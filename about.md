Computer science student at Portland State. Space and physics nerd.

Interested in Linux, embedded and low level programming, RF signals and software processing, data transmission, hardware design, satellite communications, chess, and cats. Especially the tiny fuzzy cute ones. :octocat:

Outside of my programming and cat habit, I enjoy cooking, reading every campy sci-fi book I can find, evening walks, and a nice cup of tea while a kernel compiles in the background.

On my computers, I'm a fan of [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) paired with the [awesome](https://awesomewm.org/) window manager. This site was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) from a modified template, [Stack Problems](https://github.com/agusmakmun/agusmakmun.github.io).
